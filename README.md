# Howdy

I create web applications. These days, I spend most of my time consulting with Ruby on Rails and specialize in helping teams improve their development, testing, and release processes. Thatâ€™s to say that I help teams who donâ€™t have any tests written improve their test coverage and code quality in an ongoing and sustainable manner.

I've been working on the web since 2000 and dabbling long before that. I built and ran [Sifter](https://sifterapp.com) as a sole founder for eight years before selling it, and I [wrote a book about the experience](https://startingandsustaining.com). For the full career and experience back story, You can swing by [my site](https://garrettdimon.com/about/).
