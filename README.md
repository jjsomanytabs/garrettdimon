# Howdy

I create web applications with Ruby, Rails, and Stimulus. I also help teams manage and evolve legacy Rails applications by improving tests, processes, and anything that relates to the process of developing and shipping Rails applications.

I've been working on the web since 2000 and dabbling long before that. I built and ran [Sifter](https://sifterapp.com) as a sole founder for eight years before selling it, and I [wrote a book about the experience](https://startingandsustaining.com). For the full career and experience back story, You can swing by [my site](https://garrettdimon.com/about/).
